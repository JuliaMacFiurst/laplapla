      full: `### What is LapLapLa 



LapLapLa is a learning space for children and adults, created in a world where knowledge is no longer scarce and the way we access it has fundamentally changed.

We live in a time when information is available instantly.  
A child may not yet know how to read, but already knows how to scroll, search, watch, compare, and absorb vast amounts of information through video, images, and interactive environments. Often, children know more about the world than their parents did at the same age — simply because access to information has become effortless.

And yet, education is still largely built around memorization.  
In a world where any fact can be retrieved in seconds, knowledge alone is no longer an achievement.

What truly matters now is something else:  
the ability to understand, interpret, connect ideas, process information — and create something of your own from it.

### Why this project matters

LapLapLa grew out of a simple observation:  
children already live in a world shaped by technology and artificial intelligence, but very few spaces help them learn how to interact with these tools calmly, thoughtfully, and consciously.

AI today is neither magic nor a threat.  
It is a natural tool for working with information, much like books, search engines, or calculators once were. The earlier a child learns to see AI as a helper rather than a source of ready-made answers, the more confident they will feel in the future.

At the same time, it is essential not to lose what matters most — creativity.  
As access to information becomes easier, the ability to turn knowledge into a drawing, a story, a video, music, or an idea becomes a core skill.

LapLapLa does not aim to help children “know more.”  
It creates an environment where they learn to think, ask questions, experiment, make mistakes, and create.

### The approach behind LapLapLa

There is no pressure, grading, or race for results in LapLapLa.  
What matters is not how many facts are remembered, but what a person does with what they’ve learned.

The project is built around:

- exploration instead of memorization


- play instead of enforcement


- creativity instead of correct answers



AI is used as a tool:

- for inspiration


- for explanation


- for expanding horizons



but never as a replacement for thinking.

### What it offers children

For children, LapLapLa is a safe space where:

- they can explore the world at their own pace


- they may not yet read, but already learn to understand


- any question is welcome


- knowledge can be transformed into images and ideas



It is a way to grow up in an information-rich world consciously, rather than passively.

### What it offers adults

For adults, LapLapLa provides:

- a new perspective on learning and education


- a way to be present in a child’s digital world


- an understanding of how learning is changing, and why it will never be the same



It is a space for shared exploration, not control.

### Where the project is headed

LapLapLa is a living project.  
It will evolve, grow, and experiment with new formats and tools.

But its direction remains clear:  
to create an environment where knowledge becomes the starting point for creativity,  
and technology becomes a natural extension of human thinking.`,

    forWho: {
      title: "Who it is for",

        "For kids and grown-ups who enjoy exploring, asking questions, and turning knowledge into ideas.",
      full: `### Who this project is for

LapLapLa is designed for children and adults living in a world where information is more accessible than ever, yet meaning and direction still need to be discovered rather than given.

For children, it is a space where they can:

- explore the world at their own pace, without pressure or expectations


- ask questions, even if they seem unusual or unfinished


- learn to understand the world before they can fully read it


- turn knowledge into drawings, stories, ideas, and play

Here, the goal is not to meet external expectations,  
but to experiment, make mistakes, and discover genuine curiosity.

For adults, LapLapLa offers a chance to:

- rethink learning and personal development


- be present in a child’s digital world, not as control but as support


- understand how the ways we learn are changing, and which skills truly matter

This project is for those who are not looking for ready-made answers,  
but want to learn how to think, connect ideas, and create something of their own —  
together with children or alongside them.

LapLapLa does not divide people by age or level of expertise.  
It brings together those who value curiosity  
even as the world becomes faster and more complex.`,

      full: `### About the creator

I’ve been working with kids for many years, running art and creative classes.  
I also have two kids of my own — a girl and a boy.

My kids and my students are all very different: different ages, personalities, habits, and even different home languages.  
But there’s one thing they all have in common — a quick spark of interest when something is fun, playful, and engaging… and an equally quick loss of focus the moment an adult starts talking “like a serious teacher.”

I think most of us remember that feeling from school:  
a lesson where your mind slowly drifts away, your notebook fills with little drawings, and the teacher’s voice feels distant, like it’s coming through fog.

Kids often tell me they enjoy my classes because I’m “not like other teachers.”  
The truth is, I simply try to explain things in a way that feels natural — more like a conversation than a lecture.

I can be firm when it’s needed, and I don’t encourage chaos just for the sake of it.  
But I never stop a kid who’s trying to understand something in their own way — even if that means making mistakes.  
From my experience, that kind of learning sticks far better than memorizing facts.

This project was born for two very simple reasons.

First, I learned to code.  
Coming from a purely humanities background, it was exciting and honestly just fun to step into a completely new world.

The second reason was the war.  
We spent time in the safe room. It was scary. Classes were cancelled. Kids were anxious. The tension kept building.  
At some point, we decided together to create a place online that would feel calm, safe, and interesting.  
A place where there would always be a familiar, caring voice — and where kids’ ideas could actually turn into something real.

That’s how LapLapLa started.

I don’t see this as a personal project in the narrow sense.  
It’s more like a playground that grew out of everyday life with my kids and my students.  
And I truly hope it feels like a good place for you to be, too.

I’m not a perfect parent.  
My kids eat sweets, spend time on screens, don’t always listen, and sometimes the house is a mess — and yes, that can drive me crazy. We argue sometimes. That’s real life.

This isn’t a place for “how to raise a perfect child” advice.

But it *is* a place where it matters to me that kids feel interesting to be around —  
and that they feel comfortable, curious, and safe here.

LapLapLa grew out of personal experience, openness to change, and a wish to create a space where learning, play, trying things out, and making mistakes are all welcome — without pressure or fear.

I’m always open to conversation, and I’m genuinely excited to connect with the people who find their way here, so we can keep shaping this space together — slowly, thoughtfully, and at a human pace.`,

        "Some materials are available for free. Extended features are unlocked with a subscription.",
      full: `### Access and subscription

LapLapLa is currently running in test mode.

This means that the site includes materials and features that do not require direct interaction with artificial intelligence — pre-made stories, sections, activities, and playful formats. Everything that can reasonably be offered for free, without losing meaning or quality, is available without a subscription.

Features that rely on AI generation (such as interactive creative tools, including AI-based coloring) require computing resources and cannot be provided for free. These features will become part of a subscription in the future.

At the moment, the subscription itself is not yet active.  
The project is developing gradually, and the main focus right now is to test the format, gather feedback, and understand what truly works and brings joy to both kids and adults.

If you’d like to experience LapLapLa in its fullest form, this will be possible through a subscription later on.  
For now, you’re very welcome to explore the project, use the available materials, and be part of this space from the very beginning.`,

    language: {
      title: "Language",
      preview: "You can change the interface language at any time.",
      full: `### About language

We live in Israel — in a naturally multilingual environment, where switching between languages is part of everyday life.

My kids, for example, had a hard time learning Hebrew at first, because at home we spoke only Russian.  
I know this feeling well myself — constantly moving between languages, searching for the right words, focusing on meaning rather than perfect form.

Over time, one thing became very clear to me:  
language is not the goal.  
Language is a tool.

We don’t really “learn” a language just for the language itself.  
We use it to understand, communicate, play, think, and create.

That’s why in LapLapLa any text can be switched from one language to another at any moment — to make reading easier and reduce unnecessary stress.  
So that language doesn’t become a barrier, but stays what it’s meant to be: a means of connection.

In the future, I want to take this idea further.  
To build a separate space where languages are absorbed naturally — through play, creativity, experiments, and short, light, meme-style videos that feel friendly rather than overwhelming.

No pressure.  
No “right” or “wrong.”  
Just curiosity, humor, and the feeling that language is something alive — not a school subject.`,

      full: `### About collaboration

LapLapLa is a living project, and it’s important to me that it doesn’t grow in isolation.

I’m open to collaborating with people and projects that share a similar mindset —  
an interest in learning without pressure, respect for how kids think, a love for creativity, and a desire to explore new formats instead of relying on ready-made solutions.

Collaboration can take many forms:

- shared educational or creative projects

- ideas for playful formats, activities, or tools

- visual, audio, or video-based work

- experiments at the intersection of learning, art, and technology  

I’m especially interested in working with people who aren’t afraid to try, ask questions, and build something that feels genuinely their own.

If what we’re doing resonates with you,  
if you have an idea, a thought, or simply want to start a conversation —  
I’d be very happy to connect.

LapLapLa grows through dialogue, not through a fixed master plan.`,
